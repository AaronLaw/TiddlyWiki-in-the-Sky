# TiddlyWiki in the Sky (for Dropbox)

TiddlyWiki in the Sky is an app built on Dropbox's new `dropbox.js` library. It lets you edit TiddlyWiki documents stored in your Dropbox from any browser. Because it runs entirely in the browser your data never leaves the secure channel between your browser and Dropbox.

Try it out at: http://dropbox.tiddlywiki.com/
